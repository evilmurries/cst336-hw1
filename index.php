                In an increasingly online world, cybercrime and security become a larger
                concern. Cybercrime takes many shapes and forms, so it is important to be vigilant
                in order to protect your data. The United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
                Security Agency (CISA) describes it as so:
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-001">
                It seems that everything relies on computers and the internet nowâ€”communication 
                (e.g., email, smartphones), entertainment (e.g., digital cable, mp3s), transportation 
                (e.g., car engine systems, airplane navigation), shopping (e.g., online shopping, credit cards), 
                medicine (e.g., medical equipment, medical records), and the list goes on. 
                How much of your daily life relies on computers? 
                How much of your personal information is stored either on your own computer 
                or on someone else's system?

                Cybersecurity involves protecting that information by preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber attacks.
